## detect-diabetic-retinopathy
Advanced Deep Learning and Computer Vision project

#### Objective: 
To build a CNN model using distributed training that can detect diabetic retinopathy and deploy it using TensorFlow Serving.

#### Dataset Details: 
The dataset contains a large set of high-resolution retina images taken under a variety of imaging conditions. A left and right field is provided for every subject. Images are labeled with a subject id as well as either left or right. A clinician has rated the presence of diabetic retinopathy in each image on a scale of 0 to 4. Like any real-world dataset, you will encounter noise in both the images and labels. Images may contain artifacts, be out of focus, underexposed, or overexposed.
